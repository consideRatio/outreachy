# Becoming an Outreachy Community Coordinator

Any member of the JupyterHub community can offer to become a Community
Coordinator for an Outreachy round.

Outreachy [defines what a Community Coordinator is](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#roles)
and [what their responsibilities are](https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/#coordinator)
in their documentation.

## Signing up to coordinate for JupyterHub

1. You will need an [account on the Outreachy website](https://www.outreachy.org/register/?next=/dashboard/)
2. Once you have signed up and logged in, you can visit the
   [JupyterHub community page](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/jupyterhub/)
   and click the "Coordinate for This Community" button. You will asked to read
   and confirm you understand the Coordinator duties by clicking "submit".
3. Existing Coordinators will be notified of your request and **one of them will
   need to approve your request**. Once they do so, you will have access to
   perform actions on behalf of the community.

```{note}
When a new Coordinator joins, existing Coordinators may take the opportunity to
step down from the role. This is encouraged, especially if that person has
coordinated many rounds!
