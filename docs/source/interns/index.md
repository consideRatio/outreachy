# Intern Guide

This guide should contain everything about the Outreachy application process and
internship for applicants/interns _that is specific to the JupyterHub community_.
Please make sure you also read Outreachy's
[Applicant guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/)
and [Internship guide](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/)
for the _source of truth_ of what to expect generally.
