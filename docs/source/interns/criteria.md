# Application Criteria

JupyterHub projects cover a lot of different areas of skill and topics, so
make sure to thoroughly read the description and skills of the project you
would like to apply to to make sure it aligns with your current skillset, what
skills you'd like to learn, and an area of work you are interested in.

Successful applicants to JupyterHub are expected to demonstrate the following
traits during the contribution period:

1. **Clear communication.** Building open source software is a collaborative
   venture, and effective communication is key to making it successful. Learn
   how to ask good questions, and explain your decisions clearly in your commit
   messages and on your pull requests.
2. **Improvement in response to feedback.** Don't worry if you make mistakes in
   your first few contributions! Everyone makes mistakes when they are getting
   started - just make sure that you learn from them!

We are especially excited about applicants who:

- Help out other applicants
- Try to solve their own obstacles, and then ask well-formed questions
- Develop well thought out project outlines
