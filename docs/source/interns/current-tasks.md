# List of Current Microtasks Available

```{warning}
This table will only update when we rebuild the docs. In the future, we could
either:

1. Run a cron job in CI that POSTs to ReadTheDocs' API to trigger a rebuild; or
2. Use PyScript to have the code run in the browser and, therefore, would update
   with every refresh
```

% NOTE: The CSV files used by this page are generated by helper-scripts/get-repo-issues.py

This table shows the microtasks currently available to work on during a
contribution period. The table contains a link to the issue describing the
task, a label indicating which project it is connected to, an indication of
how many applicants can work on the issue simultaneously, and a label indicating
the difficulty level of the task.

```{attention}
If the table doesn't show, that means we don't currently have any open issues!
