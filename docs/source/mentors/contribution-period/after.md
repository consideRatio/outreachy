# After the Contribution Period Closes

The [Community Coordinator](comm-cord) can help organise and facilitate these
activities if required.

## Clean up the repo

After the contribution period closes, you will probably be left with a lot of
open issues and/or pull requests in our Outreachy repo and the general
JupyterHub ecosystem!

### Closing issues

We have a provided a [short Python script](https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/blob/HEAD/helper-scripts/comment-close-issues.py)
that identifies Outreachy-related issues based on labels. It leaves a short
message thanking the contributors for their work, and then closes each issue in
turn. This is a bit quicker than doing it manually. You can read how to use
this script in the [README file for helper scripts](https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/blob/HEAD/helper-scripts/README.md#closing-microtask-issues-after-the-contribution-period-has-closed).

### Closing/merging pull requests

Try to review and merge as many pull requests as possible. It may be challenging
in terms of low quality and merge conflicts. It might be more mangeable to do
this in a sprint with the other mentors.

(contrib:after:retrospective)=
## Hold a retrospective

If you have the capacity, holding a [retrospective](https://blog.zenhub.com/tips-and-techniques-for-better-sprint-retrospective-meetings/)
after the contribution period closes is a really beneficial practice. In this
meeting, mentors should focus on answering the following questions in regard
to the completed contribution period:

- What went well?
- What didn't work well?
- What should be done differently next time?

This meeting can be facilitated by the [Community Coordinator](comm-coord) if
required.

Any pull requests improving the processes documented anywhere on this site as
a result of one of these meetings is very welcome and super appreciated!
