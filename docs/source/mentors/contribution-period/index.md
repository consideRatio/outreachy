# The Outreachy Contribution Period

The Contribution Period is a month before internships begin where Outreachy
applicants contribute to participating projects in order to learn more about
them and decide whether they want to submit their final application to that
project. It also provides mentors with examples of the applicants' work in
order to assess whether they would be able to complete the project as is, or
whether it would need to be rescoped in order to achieve either more or less
challenging goals.

These sections contain information on activities related to preparing for and
managing the Contribution Period.
