## Expectations of mentors

```{seealso}
Outreachy document the full responsibilities and expectations of participating
mentors, including time commitments, on [their website](https://www.outreachy.org/mentor/)
```

The main expectations of mentors are:

- To scope an appropriate project for an intern to complete over 13 weeks
- To scope appropriate ["microtasks"](microtasks) for applicants to complete
  during the [contribution period](contribution-period)
- Engage with applicants and answer questions/offer guidance during the
  contribution period
- Mentor the intern through your proposed project for the 13 week internship
  duration
- Provide feedback to Outreachy regarding the intern's performance

## Pair mentoring

We strongly advocate for pair-mentoring a project where possible. This can
reduce the load on mentors, provide a new mentor with support and guidance,
and cover extenuating circumstances if one mentor needs to step back for
whatever reason.

## How to sign up to mentor

```{seealso}
[Outreachy's mentor sign-up process](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/community/#mentor-sign-up-process)
```

You will need to submit a project proposal to the Outreachy platform to
register and be approved as a mentor by the [Community Coordinator](comm-coord).
