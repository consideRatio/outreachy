# During the Internship

Congratulations! You were able to find an intern to work on a project with you!
This section describes what will happen next.

## Meeting your intern

In the week before the internship starts, the [Community Coordinator](comm-coord)
should send an email connecting you and your intern. This email will prompt the
intern to arrange a regular meeting time with you, as well as covering some
ground rules such as the Code of Conduct. Please try and schedule at least 30 mins
once a week with your intern to check in with their progress. Also make sure to
set appropriate communication channels with them. We try to encourage as much
open communication on GitHub and gitter as possible, but it can be really
nerve-wracking for newcomers. Optioanlly private messaging via gitter or email
may help with this transition.

## Feedback

Mentors will be asked to provide feedback on the interns to Outreachy at set
points during the internship. This feedback allows Outreachy to ascertain how
the intern is progressing, as well as how the programme overall may be improved.
These feedback check-ins also determine whether the intern will receive their
stipend. **Please do not delay or withold an intern's stipend without discussion
with the Community Coordinator and Outreachy organisers, if necessary, first.**

## Extending the internship

In some cases, an internship can be extended to help complete a project. This
will need to be agreed upon with the Outreachy organisers as well. Note that an
extension of this kind will not pay the intern extra, but rather delay the final
stipend.
