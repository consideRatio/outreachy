# List of Project Proposals

```{warning}
This table will only update when we rebuild the docs. See
<https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/issues/157> for strategies to rectify
this.
```

% NOTE: The CSV files used by this page are generated by the script located at
% https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/blob/main/docs/source/_data/get_issues/get-repo-issues.py

This table shows the project proposals currently open as issues on the repository,
their status (whether they are being scoped, or have been submitted, etc), and
whether the project needs a mentor to steward it. Please read
[](proposing-projects:labels) to understand the labels.
