# List of Project Proposals

```{warning}
This table will only update when we rebuild the docs. See
<https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/issues/157> for strategies to rectify
this.
```

% NOTE: The CSV files used by this page are generated by the script located at
% https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/blob/main/scripts/get-repo-issues.py
% The above script is automatically run on issue opened/closed/(un)labeled
% events by a GitHub Actions workflow located at
% https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-issues.yaml
% The CSV files are then committed and pushed to the issue-data branch of the repo
% https://github.com/jupyterhub/outreachy/tree/issue-data

This table shows the project proposals currently open as issues on the repository,
their status (whether they are being scoped, or have been submitted, etc), and
whether the project needs a mentor to steward it. Please read
[](proposing-projects:labels) to understand the labels.
