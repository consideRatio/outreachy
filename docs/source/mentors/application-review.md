# Reviewing Applicants

This guide walks through the process of reviewing Outreachy final applications
and selecting an intern after the contribution period has closed.

## How to review applications

```{tip}
You can make a copy of
[this Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vQkN6J5-kPWv-cvNL06PujIxq2m5DbN-kbHd9tR3e3s/edit?usp=sharing)
to track the review process more easily
```

### Triaging process

If the projects in a given round have received a lot of contributions, it may be
required to triage them to generate a shortlist of applicants to review more
in-depth. A decision to triage may be made because, for example, a few applicants
are flooding the project(s) with a high number of low quality contributions.
The decision to begin triaging can also be made before the official end of the
contribution period and deadline for submitting final applications.

### Review process

Each applicant should be assigned two reviewers (mentors) who will rate the
contributions and final application content based on Outreachy's system
("1 - Struggling" to "5 - Amazing"). Each mentor most likely feels most
comfortable reviewing the applications for the projects they are mentoring for.
We should be mindful of that but also try to distribute the reviewing work as
evenly as possible across the mentors, especially if one project receives a lot
more applications than another. A good starting point is to assign each mentor to
review applications to their own projects as Reviewer #1, then assign them to an
application for a different project as Reviewer #2, then tweak the numbers from
there. **Each mentor has the right to ask to be reassigned from an application
they do not feel able to review.**

Mentors should try to keep their review notes private from each other so as not
to bias one another before the final selection meeting when applicants are
discussed.

In addition to the rating according to Outreachy's system referenced above,
each mentor may also want to rank the candidates. For example, rank their top
candidate as number 1, their next candidate as 2, and so on. This is completely
_optional_ but may help when discussing and comparing ratings with the other
mentors.

### Final selection meeting

Once the mentors have reviewed and rated all their assigned applications, a
meeting should be held to discuss the applicants and decide ultimately which
applicants will be invited to intern on each project.

The outcome of this meeting should be each mentor selecting an intern for their
project by clicking the "Mentor this intern" button on the Outreachy platform.
The ratings assigned during the review should also be entered into the platform
as well, even for those applicants that were not selected, as this informs
Outreachy regarding their demographics.

```{note}
If there are large disparaties in rating for an applicant from different mentors
try to resolve this disparity before entering the rating on the platform.

## Guidelines for reviewing applications

We should adhere very closely to Outreachy's guidelines for
[evaluating applications](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#contribution-evaluation).
