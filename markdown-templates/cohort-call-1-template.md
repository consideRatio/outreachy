## What is a Cohort Call?

- An opportunity for interns to work together. All of your projects relate to one another. How can you help one another?
- Learn about more general open working practices. These skills are very transferable and incredibly useful beyond the JupyterHub project.

## Group Introductions

Quick into for each intern and project. Share your plans with each other! Feel free to add questions! _(1-2 mins per intern, 10 mins total)_

- [name=Name] / Project
  - Share something here!

## Working practices over the next few months

_(~5 mins)_

- When in doubt, ask your mentors!
  - This applies to _anything_ from technical assistance to blogging or worries about evaluation
- If your mentor is not available or responsive, you can always approach **Sarah Gibson** as Community Coordinator, or any of the other mentors if needed. We'll help redirect you to the correct person if we can't help.
- Updates: Make sure your mentor knows you're alive and busy!
- Exams, assignments, feeling unwell, vacation coming up? Tell your mentor so they don't think you've disappeared!
- A good way to show you're alive and working is via GitHub commits. Aim to make small, granular commits and multiple pushes a day. These are your backups as well - computers do break sometimes.

## Break-out discussions

_(Break-out rooms, 3-4 people per room, ~15 mins to discuss + 10 mins follow up)_

### ðŸ’¬ What makes a project good?

- **When things are a train-wreck:** Think of a time when you tried to use or contribute to an open source project and things didn't go all that well. What was the reason for this? Was there anything that could have been done better, and why? Perhaps this was community, documentation, code quality, or something else. Discuss in your groups and add your thoughts to the bullet points below. Add more bullets if needed.
