:::info
It is a good practice to collect a set of points you'd like to talk to your
mentor about each week (your agenda) and keep notes of what you discuss so you
can refer back to them later. Some things you may like to talk about are:

- How your project is progressing
- Are there specific problems or questions you'd like to ask your mentor?
