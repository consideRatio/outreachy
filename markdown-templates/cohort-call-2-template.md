## What makes code "good" or "bad"?

_(10 mins)_

Think back to the last group call where we made a list of good open source practices as well as the train-wrecks we'd encountered. Could any of these apply to a code review sesion? Try to think of more, focusing on technical issues such as code quality, git commits, documentation, etc. Here is the link to the last call to refresh your memory: {{insert link to previous call's notes here}}

### :pencil2: Things you never want to see in a code repo :no_good: (but maybe have)

- write something here
- write something here
- write something here

### :pencil2: Things that make a code repo really easy to work with, update, run :ok_hand:

- write something here
- write something here
- write something here

## :speech_balloon: Breakout rooms: Code review practice

We'll start by reviewing code that isn't written by anyone in the group. _(15 mins)_

- **Thinking:** _(3 mins)_
  - Pick **one** of these repos:
    - https://github.com/madetech/sensible_logging
    - https://github.com/taverna/taverna-svn
    - https://github.com/biopython/biopython
    - https://github.com/mozilla/jschannel
  - Spend a couple of minutes looking through your chosen repo. Note down 2-3 points each for:
    - Things that could be improved
    - Good quality code
- **Sharing:** _(3 mins per person)_
  - Share one good thing and one thing that could be improved with your group. Try to bring something new that wasn't discussed before!
  - Did the group agree with your assessment? Discuss.

## :speech_balloon: Breakout rooms: Code review

This time we will review code you've been working on for Outreachy.

### Sharing & feedback

_(7 mins per person)_

Share the code repository (or just one of them, if you have multiple repos) that you've been working on with JupyterHub for Outreachy.
Your group mates will spend a couple of minutes looking at your code repo, and like before:

- Try to find 1-2 things to improve
- Try to find 1-2 good things about the repo / code

Each group member should share one good thing and one thing to improve, then move onto the next code repo.
